## **Start developing.**

Run the app: `npm start`

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories

    .
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

5.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

6.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

7.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
